# MSc_Dissertation_Unity_Project
 Unity part of my MSc Robotics and Computation dissertation. The project uses ROS# to connect to the Astrobee Simulator in ROS (Gazebo). The VR interface is used as a teleoperation tool for the Astrobee.

* 25/07: 
  * Gaps exist in ISS model in all of Unity, Rviz and Gazebo. ISS model spawns upside down in Gazebo and Unity.
  * Docking station and Astrobee do not spawn in correct locations in Unity (only urdf used, config not checked)
